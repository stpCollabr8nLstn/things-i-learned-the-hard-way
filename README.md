# Things I Learned The Hard Way

#### Why, tho?

Howdy!

I'm Adriana ðŸ¦„. I like to build things using Javascript (React makes me happiest but I can play nicely with others). I've made this collection of things that, honestly, sort of scared me a bit as a new and growing developer. Sometimes things look easy but when you start building you uncover unexpected complexity that makes you do this:

I'll continue to add as I find new things that challenge me and help me grow. My intention is to add documentation to each bit explaining where I got stuck and why followed by how I resolved it. If at any time you see where I missed these steps I encourage you to open an issue to let me know.
